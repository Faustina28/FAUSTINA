        <h2 align="center">About Coronavirus</h2>
        <p> Coronavirus is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus.

        Most people who fall sick with Covid-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment

        The virus that causes Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through droplet generated when an infected person coughs,sneezes,or exhales.

        These droplet are too heavy to hang in the air,and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
        
        You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has Covid-19,or by touching a contaminated surfaceand then your eyes,nose or mouth.
